# executed by udhcpc
# parameters: $1 and environment
# $1 is:
#
# deconfig: udhcpc starts, or lease is lost.
# Environment example: interface=eth0
#
# bound: lease is obtained. Environment example:
# dhcptype=5
# serverid=172.16.42.102
# lease=97200
# interface=eth0
# ip=172.16.42.177
# subnet=255.255.255.0
# mask=24
# broadcast=172.16.22.255
# router=172.16.42.98
# dns=10.34.32.125 10.32.63.5 10.34.255.7 10.11.255.27
# domain=lab.example.com example.com
# ntpsrv=10.34.32.125 10.34.255.7
#
# renew: lease is renewed. Environment is similar to "bound".
# The IP address does not change, however, the other DHCP parameters,
# such as the default gateway, subnet mask, and dns server may change.
#
# nak: udhcpc received a NAK message.
# Environment example: interface=eth0
#
# leasefail: udhcpc cannot obtain a lease (DHCP server not responding, etc).
# Environment example: interface=eth0
